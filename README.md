# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
This is a command-line application that accepts user input to generate an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster and includes the team's basic info, emails, and GitHub profiles.

## Installation
Clone repo: https://github.com/smcgarr13/Team-Profile-Generator

## Usage
Simply answer the question prompts starting with the "Manager".  Once the "Manager" has been declared, the menu options will show "Engineer", "Intern", and "Finish building team" â€“ continue answering the respective question prompts. Once you have selected "Finish building team", your HTML file will be generated automatically and you can review your team roster on the browser.

All email addresses and GitHub profiles are "clickable" and will redirect you to the respective links.  When you click on an email address in the HTML, your default email program will open and the email address "clicked" will populate in the "TO" field of the email.  When you click on the GitHub username in the HTML, that GitHub profile will open in a new tab.
